            <p>let me guess, she treated you like her boyfriend instead of a friend told you all of her secrets and everything
                 and you started to think that she loves you and the day you confessed your feelings she hit you with 'i don't want a relationship' 
                 and your heart brokeðŸ’” my friend don't worry everyone has gone through that phase where you question your self that "why does this happen 
                 to me just me every damn time?". and now you don't trust anyone and you still think that you were wrong somewhere your mind knows that she did it but your heart is not accepting the truth. Right?</p>
